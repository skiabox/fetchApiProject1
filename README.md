# FetchApiProject1

Fetch API demonstration<br />

I create three buttons that demontrate 3 different use cases.<br />

Get text from a local text file, get json data from a local json file, and finally get api data from an external api.<br />

Instructions:<br />

npm install -> installs all the libraries<br />
npm run dev -> creates the webpack bundle and watches for changed files<br />

You can use live server to open the html file.
